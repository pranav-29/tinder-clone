# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In this project i had used some more libraries
for icon, iconButton & slide effect 

for icon i used the library given below:

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

and 

npm install  @mui/icons-material

after this i had inserted all the icons and icons button that i want
and then i want to insert slide effect then i had used the library given below:

npm install --save react-tinder-card --legacy-peer-deps

after this i designed owr software and make it as per our requirements
or added some restriction for swipe and it's ready to use...!!
